# NP_Project 4: SOCKS Server (Version 4)

In this project, we are asked to implement the SOCKS 4 firewall protocol in the application layer of the OSI model.

There are two types of the SOCKS operations (i.e. CONNECT and BIND). We have to implement both of them.

Two parts of this project we need to finish,

  1. Write a SOCKS Server, support connect mode and bind mode, and use socks.conf to setting specific firewall rule on SOCKS Server.
  2. Write a SOCKS Client, we improve cgi.c code in Project3, connect to SOCKS Server instead of directly connection to ras/rwg Server.

You can find more detail in spec/
